Horiseon CSS and HTML semantic Clean up.

This is a learning project for CWRU's coding bootcamp.  The project is designed for students like myself to clean up redundancies in 
the CSS style sheet, add semantic HTML to the orginal code, make the href links function, and provide alt descriptions to the images
for accessibility purposes.

Zachary Svoboda Zsvoboda87 edited this file to meet those specifications.  The orginal file was provided by Case Western University's Web Development boot camp instructional team.

Changes were made to add semantic html elements including <nav>, <header, <section>, <article>, <footer>

CSS Classes were consolidated and renamed for similar styled sections.
